This directory is about structures and typedef:
	Structures are data types that are defined by the
	programmer so that he or she can accomodate different 
	data type members under one single name to suit the sort 
	of real life situation he/she wants to achieve

	typedef - this is my favourite part in case you dont want to
		use a certain data type name such as maybe int or char
		you can just use the keyword typedef to customise to whatever 
		name you prefer yourself. Eg typedef int Hassan; and with this we 
		can declare an int variable by just using: Hassan a;
