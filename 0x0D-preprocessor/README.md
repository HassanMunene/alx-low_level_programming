This dir will take us through different task for us to understand the concept of
preprocessors we have preprocessor directives, macros, header files and how vital they
are to our source code.
we also get to understand the function of preprocessor before the compilatiion 
process
some of the functions include:
1 adding files to the source code before the compilations process
2 creating inline code 
3 removing some lines of code before compilation using conditional directives.
