In this dir, we will be looking at two concepts:
1) malloc - used to allocate memory dynamically during runtime of a program
	  - and return a pointer to the adress of the memory in heap
2) free - This is used to free up dynamially allocated memories by functions such as malloc.
	- free() enables us to use memory space efficiently
